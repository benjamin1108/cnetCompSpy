Many Google Cloud customers have deep investments in third-party ISV security solutions such as appliances to secure their networks and enforce consistent policies across multiple clouds. However, integrating these security solutions into the cloud application environment comes with its own set of challenges:

  * **Network re-architecture:** Integrating third-party appliances for traffic inspection often necessitates a network redesign to route application traffic through them. With the high rate of change in a cloud application environment, this process can be error-prone, add operational overhead, and slow down application deployment time. 

  * **High cost of operation:** The inability to selectively route traffic to third-party appliances for inspection leads to overprovisioning and increased costs. Customers often invest in larger, more expensive appliances to handle all their traffic, regardless of applications’ security inspection needs. 

  * **Difficulty meeting compliance requirements:** Meeting security and regulatory requirements for an application deployment can be complex and often requires customers to implement custom tooling.

Today, we’re pleased to announce [Network Security Integration](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs) to address these challenges. Network Security Integration helps you integrate third-party network appliance or service deployments with your Google Cloud workloads while maintaining consistent policies across hybrid and multicloud environments — without changing your routing policies or network architecture. Network Security Integration also enables comprehensive workload traffic visibility, advanced network security, and application/network performance monitoring. It uses Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation, a.k.a. Geneve tunneling, to securely deliver traffic to third-party inspection destinations without modifying the original packets.

Additionally, Network Security Integration helps accelerate application deployments and compliance with a producer/consumer model. This allows infrastructure operations teams to provide collector infrastructure as a service to application development teams, enabling dynamic consumption of infrastructure as a service. Support for the hierarchical firewall policy management helps enforce compliance without introducing delays.

Network Security Integration offers two primary modes:

  * **Out-of-band integration (GA):** Mirrors desired traffic to a separate destination for offline analysis

  * **In-band integration (Preview):** Directs specific traffic to a third-party security stack for inline inspection

### **Network Security Integration out-of-band**

Running **out-of-band,** Network Security Integration transparently mirrors packets destined to and from the workload to a destination collector group. Geneve helps ensure secure transmission to the destination.

Running Network Security Integration out-of-band lends itself to the following use cases:

  * **Implementing advanced network security** \- Use advanced offline analysis to detect known attacks based on predetermined signature patterns, and also identify previously unknown attacks with anomaly-based detection. Granular filtering capabilities ensure that vulnerable workload traffic is mirrored for advanced inspection.

  * **Improve application availability and performance** \- Diagnose and analyze what's going on over the wire instead of relying only on application logs. Network traffic analysis tools leverage machine learning and analytics to inspect mirrored packet data, baselining the normal behavior of the network and then detecting anomalies that might indicate potential availability or performance issues.

  * **Support regulatory and compliance requirements** \- Finance and other regulated industries are required to capture and retain specific types of network traffic for a predetermined period to meet stringent requirements for auditing and forensic investigations.

### **Network Security Integration in-band**

With **in-band** integration, traffic ingressing or egressing a workload can be intercepted and redirected to a security stack where the traffic is inspected for threats and compliance with security policy. The bump-in-the-wire implementation of in-band interception lets you inspect traffic between the VPC or even between different application components within the same VPC. With this, you can now shrink your security domain to as small as a workload, to deploy true Zero Trust security in your environment.

Choose to run Network Security Integration in-band for the following scenarios:

  * **Integrate natively with Cloud Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) and third-party firewall** \- Network Security Integration simplifies the deployment of Google Cloud NGFW and third-party security solutions. It allows you to deploy third-party security services for traffic that requires additional security controls, while using Cloud NGFW's distributed firewall features for optimized inspection.

  * **Insert your preferred network security solution into brownfield application environments** \- Network Security Integration in-band is an elegant solution for integrating third-party security appliances directly into your existing network infrastructure, without requiring any modifications to your current routing configuration. By implementing it in-band, you can introduce additional layers of security and protection to your application traffic, helping to ensure comprehensive safeguarding against potential network threats.
