For over 25 years, Google has pushed the boundaries of the network, with innovations that connect billions of users around the world to essential services like Gmail, YouTube, and Search. At the foundation lies [Google's vast backbone network](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/google-global-network-principles-and-innovations). With 202 points of presence (PoPs), powered by over 2 million miles of fiber, 33 subsea cables, and backed by a 99.99% reliability SLA, Google's network provides a robust and resilient global platform. 

That same planet-scale network infrastructure powers Google Cloud and our [Cross-Cloud Network](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/cross-cloud-network) solutions. And today we are announcing that Google’s global network is available for all businesses and governments to use with our new [Cloud WAN solution](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/cross-cloud-network#secure-access-for-hybrid-workforce).

Cloud WAN is a fully managed, reliable, and secure enterprise backbone to transform enterprise wide area network (WAN) architectures. It leverages Google’s planet-scale network, which is optimized for application performance. Cloud WAN provides up to 40% faster performance1 compared to the public internet, and up to a 40% savings2 in total cost of ownership (TCO) over a customer-managed WAN solution. 

### **The evolution of the enterprise WAN**

Traditionally, enterprises relied heavily on multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks for secure and reliable site-to-site connectivity — a high-cost approach. However, the rapid adoption of SaaS and cloud applications necessitated a transformation, leading to the emergence of SD-WAN with direct internet access (DIA), a lower-cost alternative that leveraged the internet. Then, to enhance application performance, enterprises built colocation-based cloud on-ramps, which, while improving latency, introduced complexity and costs. This evolution led to a proliferation of security stacks, with a mix of security service edge (SSE) and self-managed appliances, creating an inconsistent security posture. 

Consequently, enterprise connectivity has become inherently complex and difficult to manage, marked by diverse networks with fragmented security, and requiring a constant balancing of reliability, speed, and cost. 

The rapid emergence of AI has placed additional demands on enterprise networks. AI-based applications require a highly distributed infrastructure that is often spread across different clouds and on-premises data centers, and need a global network that can scale massively, provide robust security and privacy, and make efficient use of resources, all while remaining cost-effective.

To address these needs, Cloud WAN offers a unified enterprise network solution for securely and reliably connecting across any enterprise site, application and user, while helping to ensure optimal performance and reducing costs.

Cloud WAN enables two key use cases: providing high-performance connectivity between geographically dispersed data centers, and connecting branch and campus environments over our [Premium Tier network](https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers).
