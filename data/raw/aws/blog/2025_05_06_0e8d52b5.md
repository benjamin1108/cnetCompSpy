From startups to enterprises, thousands of software as a service (SaaS) solutions harness the power of [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) to secure, scale, and accelerate their applications globally. Building on over [16 years of innovation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/happy-anniversary-amazon-cloudfront-15-years-of-evolution-and-internet-advancements/), we are introducing Amazon CloudFront SaaS Manager, a long-awaited capability for CloudFront customers.

CloudFront SaaS Manager revolutionizes how platform providers manage multi-domain content delivery networks (CDN) on CloudFront. Organizations can now scale their web applications across millions of subdomains and vanity domains without hitting infrastructure ceilings or compromising security. Through improved integration with adjacent Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, CloudFront delivers automated certificate management, unified security controls, and streamlined configuration management—all within the trusted AWS ecosystem. This solution dramatically reduces operational complexity while making sure of high-performance content delivery and enterprise-grade security for every customer domain.

CloudFront SaaS Manager introduces a new type of distribution called a [Multi-Tenant Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-config-options.html#:~:text=Multi%2Dtenancy,while%20maintaining%20their%20own%20customizations.). This enables you to secure, deliver, and accelerate content across multiple tenants while sharing configuration and infrastructure. It streamlines multi-tenancy by enabling the sharing of configuration, while maintaining flexibility with granular tenant-specific configurations.

In this post, we explore the new CloudFront SaaS Manager, demonstrating how to implement and use this capability to deliver high-performance and enterprise-grade security for your customer domains. We delve into key use cases where this capability is beneficial and walk through step-by-step instructions for implementation and best-practices.

## Determining when to use CloudFront SaaS Manager

Before we dive into details, we can observe some common scenarios where CloudFront SaaS Manager is suitable:

  * **SaaS providers with custom domains:** Enable your SaaS customers to use their own branded domains. You can provide white-labeled experiences that maintain their brand identity, while using the CloudFront global infrastructure. This approach is widely used by leading Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers, allowing their users to deliver seamless, branded experiences to customers while benefiting from enhanced security and faster performance.
  * **SSL/TLS security management at scale:** Simplify certificate lifecycle management by automatically handling the entire SSL lifecycle for customer domains, such as issuance, validation, renewal, and re-issuance, across all your customer domains.
  * **Tiered acceleration and security with centralized operations:** Implement tailored security and acceleration capabilities across your customer segments. This streamlines operations by managing shared configurations from a single template distribution. It allows you to offer varied levels of DDoS protection, WAF rules, and performance optimizations based on your [SaaS tenant tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/saas-lens/tenant-tiers.html), while reducing operational overhead and making sure of a consistent baseline.
  * **Dynamic content delivery:** Enable tenant-specific content delivery rules while maintaining shared origin configurations, optimizing performance and costs across your customer base with granular control.

If your application doesn’t need multi-tenancy capabilities, then the CloudFront *Standard Distribution* continues to provide the same powerful features and performance on which you rely.

## New capabilities in CloudFront SaaS Manager

CloudFront SaaS Manager allows you to create the following resources:

  * **Multi-tenant distribution:** Create a template that defines shared settings for origins, cache behaviors, and security across multiple domains. When you operate in tenant-only mode, you can’t serve traffic directly, but you can provide parameters that enable tenant-specific customizations while maintaining consistent baseline configurations. You create parameters for Origin Domain Names and Unique Origin Paths. This approach helps you make sure of standardization while giving you flexibility for individual tenant needs.
  * **Distribution tenant:** Create a tenant-specific implementation that inherits configuration from the Multi-Tenant Distribution. Assign at least one domain name with valid TLS certificate coverage to each tenant. You can customize each tenant with unique origin paths, further domain names, Web ACL overrides, and custom TLS certificates.

## Example scenario with an e-commerce SaaS platform

As an example, imagine Example Corp, an e-commerce SaaS platform that enables online store creation and management. As Example Corp, you have defined three pricing tiers: Basic, Premium, and Enterprise. These three tiers span across over 1,000,000 active customers.

You provide each customer with a dedicated `<anycompany>.example.com` subdomain and a shared [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket for their assets. When customers upgrade to your Premium or Enterprise tier, you allow them to use custom vanity domains, while providing them with advanced security protections, improved content acceleration, and a dedicated S3 bucket for their assets.

To achieve this, you create one Multi-Tenant Distribution for each tier, as shown in the following figure:

  1. **Basic tier:** You include a wildcard certificate for `*.example.com`, implement basic caching rules, and protect it with [AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/). You provide each Basic tier customer with their own distribution tenant, but you do not allow for customization at the tenant level.
  2. **Premium tier:** You build upon the Basic tier by adding [Origin Shield](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html) to improve performance. You allow Premium Tier customers to customize their distribution tenant with certificates for vanity domains (such as `<anycompany>.com`).
  3. **Enterprise tier:** You include all Premium tier features plus [AWS WAF Bot Control](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/features/bot-control/) capabilities in the [WebACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html) for more protection. Like the Premium tier, you allow Enterprise tier customers to also use custom certificates for their vanity domains. For specific customers, you provide customization of security settings by associating different WebACLs for distribution tenants associated with these customers.

*Figure 1: High-level illustration of example scenario with CloudFront SaaS Manager*

These examples serve only as illustrations. In practice, you can apply these tiers to different customer segments, operational regions, or whatever makes the most sense for your SaaS organization. Beyond Amazon S3, CloudFront supports a [wide range of origins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DownloadDistS3AndCustomOrigins.html) including [VPC Origins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DownloadDistS3AndCustomOrigins.html), [Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) and [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

## Create multi-tenant distribution with CloudFront in just a few clicks

In this section, we walk through the steps to create the multi-tenant distributions (and S3 buckets) defined previously.

### Prerequisites

  * Ensure you have an AWS account with appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to create and manage AWS resources including S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, WAFs and Route53 DNS records.
  * Obtain or create the necessary SSL/TLS certificates in [AWS Certificate Manager](http://AWS Certificate Manager) for your domains.
  * Decide on your naming conventions for S3 buckets and domains.

### Basic tier: creating a multi-tenant distribution with a single (pooled) distribution tenant and subdomain per tenant

1\. Create an**S3 bucket** (pooled bucket) to store assets for all Basic tier tenants.

2\. In the **CloudFront** console, click **Create Distribution**.

3\. Select the **Multi-tenant architecture** option.

![CloudFront SaaS Manager Console - Distribution options](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/24/CF-SaaS-Manager-Multi-tenant-Distribution.png)

  1. Enter a name for the distribution.
  2. Configure the distribution with the wildcard certificate (e.g. `*.example.com`).

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Provide Basic Details](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/25/CF-SaaS-Manager-Provide-Basic-Details.png)

  3. For the **origin** , select the shared S3 bucket created in Step 1.

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Specify Origin](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/24/CF-SaaS-Manager-Specify-Origin.png)

  4. Configure the **cache and origin settings** using AWS recommended defaults.

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Create Distribution](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/24/CF-SaaS-Manager-Create-Distribution.png)

That concludes the creation of the multi-tenant distribution. Now, you create a distribution tenant.

5\. In the CloudFront**Distribution Tenants** console, click **Create** **tenant** or**Create****distribution tenant**.

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Tenants](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/24/CF-SaaS-Manager-Tenants.png)

  1. In the **Custom TLS certificate** field, retain the default wildcard certificate (e.g. `*.example.com`).
  2. In the **Domain** field, enter `*.example.com` to enable the distribution to serve all Basic Tier tenants under this domain.
  3. Review and create the **distribution tenant**.

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Pooled Tenant](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/24/CF-SaaS-Manager-Pooled-Tenant.png)

A pooled distribution tenant will now be created for Basic tier tenants. For each new Basic tier tenant you onboard:

  1. Create a **DNS record** (e.g. `tenant1.example.com`) that points to the CloudFront distribution’s endpoint
  2. (optional) Repeat for additional Basic tier tenants.

### Premium tier: creating a parameterized multi-tenant distribution with Origin Shield for improved performance and support for vanity domain per tenant

1\. In the **CloudFront** console, click **Create Distribution**.

2\. Select the **Multi-tenant architecture** option.

  1. Enter a name for the distribution.
  2. Select **Amazon S3** as the origin.
  3. Add a `customer-name` parameter using the **Insert parameter** feature.
  4. For the S3 origin, use a parameterized bucket name (e.g. `amzn-s3-demo-bucket-{{customer-name}}.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - S3 Origin](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/24/CF-SaaS-Manager-S3-Origin.png)

3\. Enable **Origin Shield** and select the region closest to your CloudFront origin to improve performance for Premium tier tenants.

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Origin Shield](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/25/CF-SaaS-Manager-Origin-Shield-1.png)

  1. Configure the **cache** , **origin** , and **security settings** as recommended.
  2. Review all settings and click **Create Distribution**

4\. For each new Premium tier tenant you onboard:

  1. Create a dedicated **S3 bucket** named according to your parameterized origin (e.g. `amzn-s3-demo-bucket-example-org`).
  2. Create a **distribution tenant** referencing the multi-tenant distribution.
  3. Assign a custom SSL certificate (validated by the tenant) via AWS Certificate Manager.
  4. Set the tenant’s preferred vanity domain (e.g. `assets.example.org`).

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Premium Tier Tenant Domain](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/25/CF-SaaS-Manager-Premium-Tier-Tenant-Domain.png)

*Note:`assets.example.org` is illustrative only. In practice, you can use an apex domain as a vanity domain for your tenant (e.g. `<anycompany>.com`).*

  5. Set the `customer-name` parameter to match the tenant’s identifier (e.g. `example-org`)

![CloudFront SaaS Manager - Tenant Parameter Configuration](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/04/25/CF-SaaS-Manager-Tenant-Parameter-Configuration.png)

  6. Review and create the new **distribution tenant**.
  7. (optional) Repeat for additional tenants.

### Enterprise tier: creating a multi-tenant distribution with Origin Shield for improved performance, support for vanity domain per tenant and WAF Bot Control for additional security

1\. In the **CloudFront** console, create a new multi-tenant distribution with settings similar to the Premium tier.

2\. After the distribution is created, navigate to the **Security** tab, **Sampled bot requests for the specified time range** section, and click **Manage Bot Protection**.

3\. Review information and select the **Enable Bot Control for common bots** checkbox.

![CloudFront for SaaS - Managed Bot Protection](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5b384ce32d8cdef02bc3a139d4cac0a22bb029e8/2025/05/02/CF-for-SaaS-Managed-Bot-Protection.png)

4\. (optional) For advanced bot protection, navigate to the associated **WAF WebACL** and add **Bot Control rule groups**.

5\. For each new Enterprise tier tenant you onboard:

  1. Create a dedicated **S3 bucket** for the tenant’s assets.
  2. Create a **distribution tenant** referencing the multi-tenant distribution.
  3. Assign a **custom SSL certificate** (validated by the tenant) via AWS Certificate Manager.
  4. Set the tenant’s vanity **domain** (e.g. `<anycompany>.com`).
  5. (optional) Override the default WAF with a new tenant-specific **WAF**.
  6. (optional) Navigate to the new tenant-specific **WAF** and customize it according to the tenant’s requirements.
  7. Review and create the new **distribution tenant**.
  8. (optional) Repeat for additional Enterprise tier tenants.

### Cleanup

If you no longer need the AWS resources, be sure to delete any unnecessary S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, WAFs, and Route 53 DNS records to prevent incurring unnecessary charges.

## Advanced use cases with CloudFront Functions

If your application needs to support advanced scenarios (such as [data-driven tenant routing](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/tenant-routing-strategies-for-saas-applications-on-aws/)), you can use [CloudFront Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-functions.html) to dynamically route requests based on headers, cookies, or JWT tokens, all with sub-millisecond latency at the edge. With CloudFront SaaS Manager, you can now use [helper methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/saas-specific-logic-function-code.html) to retrieve tenant-specific parameter values directly from your multi-tenant distribution within CloudFront Functions. This capability, in addition to [CloudFront KeyValueStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/kvs-with-functions.html), provides you with flexibility for managing multi-tenant use cases at the edge.
