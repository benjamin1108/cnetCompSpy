# API Gateway launches support for dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) endpoints

Posted on: Mar 31, 2025 

Amazon API Gateway (APIGW) introduces dual-stack support for all endpoint types, custom domains and APIGW management APIs. You can now configure your REST, HTTP or WebSocket APIs as well as custom domains, to accept calls from IPv6 clients alongside the existing IPv4 support. You can also call APIGW management APIs from dual-stack clients.  
  
With simultaneous support for both IPv4 and IPv6 clients, you are able to gradually transition from IPv4 to IPv6 environments, without needing to switch all over at once. This enables you to meet IPv6 compliance requirements and avoid IPv4 address constraints. There is no additional charge for this support.  
  
This support is now available in all API Gateway commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more, see [API Gateway developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-ip-address-type.html) and [IPv6 on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/ipv6-on-aws/internet-protocol-version-6.html).
