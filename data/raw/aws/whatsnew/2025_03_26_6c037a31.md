# Amazon Route 53 Profiles now supports Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Service Endpoints

Posted on: Mar 26, 2025 

Amazon Route 53 Profiles introduces dual stack support for the Route 53 Profiles API endpoints, enabling you to connect using Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), or dual stack clients. The existing Route 53 Profiles endpoints supporting IPv4 will remain available for backwards compatibility.  
  
Route 53 Profiles makes it easy for you can create one or more configurations for VPC-related DNS settings, such as private hosted zones and Route 53 Resolver rules, and share them across VPCs and AWS accounts. The urgency to transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is driven by the continued growth of internet, which is exhausting available Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses. With simultaneous support for both IPv4 and IPv6 clients on Route 53 Profiles endpoints, you are able to gradually transition from IPv4 to IPv6 based systems and applications, without needing to switch all over at once. This enables you to meet IPv6 compliance requirements and removes the need for expensive networking equipment to handle the address translation between IPv4 and IPv6.  
  
Support for IPv6 on Route 53 Profiles is available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where Route 53 Profiles is available. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/r53.html#r53_region) for a full listing of our Regions. You can get started with the feature through AWS CLI or [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home).
