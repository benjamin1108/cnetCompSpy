# Amazon WorkSpaces Personal now supports AWS Global Accelerator

Posted on: Dec 20, 2024 

Amazon WorkSpaces Personal now integrates with AWS Global Accelerator (AGA) to enhance WorkSpaces connection performance by optimizing streaming traffic through the AWS Global Network and edge locations. This feature particularly benefits customers whose end users connect to WorkSpaces across long distances.  
  
The AGA feature can be enabled at either the WorkSpaces directory level or for individual WorkSpaces running DCV protocol. When advantageous, the service automatically routes the streaming traffic through the nearest AWS edge location and across AWS's congestion-free, redundant global network, delivering a more responsive and stable streaming experience. The WorkSpaces service fully manages AGA usage, subject to outbound data volume limits detailed in WorkSpaces documentation.  
  
This enhancement is available at no additional cost for Personal WorkSpaces running DCV protocol in all AWS Regions [where Amazon WorkSpaces is supported](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/), except Africa (Cape Town), Israel (Tel Aviv), AWS GovCloud (US), and China Regions.  
  
Customers can configure this feature through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or Amazon WorkSpaces APIs. For detailed configuration instructions and best practices, please refer to the [Amazon WorkSpaces documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/amazon-workspaces-aga.html).
