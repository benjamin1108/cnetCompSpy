# Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow introduces a new visual editor to improve DNS policy editing

Posted on: Mar 13, 2025 

Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow now offers an enhanced user interface for improved DNS traffic policy editing. Route 53 Traffic Flow is a network traffic management feature which simplifies the process of creating and maintaining DNS records in large and complex configurations by providing users with an interactive DNS policy management flow chart in their web browsers. With this release, you can more easily understand and change the way traffic is routed between users and endpoints using the new features of the visual editor.  
  
Now, Traffic Flow introduces a clearer way to craft DNS routing policies for many endpoints and multiple routing methods by moving configurations into a new sidebar, providing an undo/redo button, and introducing a new text editor for changing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files right within your browser. The JSON editor also includes syntax highlighting and can be used in conjunction with a new ‘Dark Mode’ theme to show where the policy edits should be made.  
  
The new Traffic Flow experience is available globally, except in AWS GovCloud and Amazon Web Services in China. Traffic Flow pricing information can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/) and these enhancements are offered at no additional cost.
