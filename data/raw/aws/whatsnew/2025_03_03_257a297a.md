# Amazon API Gateway now supports HTTP APIs, mTLS, multi-level base path mappings, and WAF in additional regions

Posted on: Mar 3, 2025 

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) (APIGW) now supports all features of HTTP APIs as well as Mutual TLS and multi-level base path mappings on REST APIs in the following additional Regions: Middle East (UAE), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Europe (Zurich), Europe (Spain), Israel (Tel Aviv), and Canada West (Calgary). AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for REST APIs is now available in two additional regions: Asia Pacific (Kuala Lumpur) and Canada West (Calgary).  
  
HTTP APIs simplify API development for serverless applications with a simpler user interface that includes support for OAuth2.0 and automatic deployments. Mutual TLS enhances security by authenticating x509 certificate based identities at the APIGW. Multi-level base path mappings enable routing requests based on segments in custom domain paths, supporting path-based versioning and traffic redirection. Integration of AWS WAF offers APIs protections against common web exploits through configurable rules that allow, block, or monitor web requests.
