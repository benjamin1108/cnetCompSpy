# Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor adds AWS Local Zones support for VPC subnets

Posted on: Nov 21, 2024 

Today, Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor introduces support for select AWS Local Zones. Now, you can monitor internet traffic performance for VPC subnets deployed in Local Zones.  
  
With this new feature, you can also view optimization suggestions that include Local Zones. On the Optimize tab in the Internet Monitor console, select the toggle to include Local Zones in traffic optimization suggestions for your application. Additionally, you can compare your current configuration with other supported Local Zones. Select the option to see more optimization suggestions, and then choose specific Local Zones to compare. By comparing latency differences, you can determine the proposed best configuration for your traffic.  
  
At launch, CloudWatch Internet Monitor supports the following Local Zones: us-east-1-dfw-2a, us-east-1-mia-2a, us-east-1-qro-1a, us-east-1-lim-1a, us-east-1-atl-2a, us-east-1-bue-1a, us-east-1-mci-1a, us-west-2-lax-1a, us-west-2-lax-1b, and af-south-1-los-1a.
