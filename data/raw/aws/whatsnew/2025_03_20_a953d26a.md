# AWS Network Firewall introduces new flow management feature

Posted on: Mar 20, 2025 

Today, AWS announces a new flow management feature for AWS Network Firewall that enables customers to identify and control active network flows. This feature introduces two key functions: Flow Capture, which allows point-in-time snapshots of active flows, and Flow Flush, which enables selective termination of specific connections. With these new capabilities, customers can now view and manage active flows based on criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols, providing enhanced control over their network traffic.  
  
This new feature helps customers maintain consistent security policies when updating firewall rules and enables rapid response during security incidents. Network administrators can now easily validate security configurations and ensure that all traffic is evaluated against current policies. The flow management feature is particularly valuable for troubleshooting network issues and isolating suspicious traffic during security events. By providing granular control over active network flows, AWS Network Firewall enhances customers' ability to maintain a secure and efficient network environment.  
  
The new flow management feature is available in all regions where AWS Network Firewall is supported, allowing customers to benefit from these enhanced capabilities across their global infrastructure.  
  
Customers can start using Flow Capture and Flow Flush at no additional cost. To get started, visit the [AWS Network Firewall documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html), explore the new APIs in the [Network Firewall API Reference guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html), or learn more about AWS Network Firewall on the [product page](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/).
