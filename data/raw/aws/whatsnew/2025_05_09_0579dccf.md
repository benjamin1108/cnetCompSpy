# Amazon VPC Reachability Analyzer now supports resource exclusion

Posted on: May 9, 2025 

Amazon [VPC Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html) now supports the ability to exclude network resources when analyzing reachability between a source and destination, providing you greater flexibility to run reachability analyses.  
  
VPC Reachability Analyzer is a configuration analysis feature that enables you to check network reachability between a source resource and a destination resource in your virtual private clouds (VPCs). With this launch, you can easily identify an alternative traffic path in your network. For example, if you want to identify any path from your internet gateway to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) that is not passing through the network firewall for inspection, you can specify Network Firewall under resource exclusion and run the reachability analysis. If the analysis returns a reachable path, you know there is an alternative path in your network and can take required actions.
