# AWS announces new AWS Direct Connect location and expansion in Querétaro, Mexico

Posted on: Jan 14, 2025 

Today, AWS announced the opening of a new [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect) location within the Equinix MX1, Querétaro, Mexico data center near Mexico City. By connecting your network to AWS at the new location, you gain private, direct access to all public AWS Regions (except those in China), AWS GovCloud Regions, and [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/). This site is the second AWS Direct Connect location within Mexico. The new Direct Connect location offers dedicated 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps connections with MACsec encryption available.

AWS also announced the addition of 10Gbps and 100Gbps MACsec services in the existing KIO Networks data center in Querétaro, Mexico.  
  
The Direct Connect service enables you to establish a private, physical network connection between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. These private connections can provide a more consistent network experience than those made over the public internet.
