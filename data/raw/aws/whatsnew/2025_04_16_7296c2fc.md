# Amazon CloudFront announces Anycast Static IPs support for apex domains

Posted on: Apr 16, 2025 

Amazon CloudFront announces Anycast Static IPs support for apex domains, enabling customers to easily use their root domain (e.g., example.com) with CloudFront. This new feature simplifies DNS management by providing just 3 static IP addresses instead of the previous 21, making it easier to configure and manage apex domains with CloudFront distributions.  
  
Previously, customers had to create CNAME records to point their domains to CloudFront. However, due to DNS rules, root domains (apex domains) cannot point to CNAME records and must use A records or Route53's ALIAS records. With the new Anycast Static IPs support, customers can now easily configure A records for their apex domains. Organizations can maintain their existing DNS infrastructure while using CloudFront's global content delivery network to deliver apex domains with low latency and high data transfer speeds. Anycast routing automatically directs traffic to the optimal edge location, ensuring high performance content delivery for end users worldwide.  
  
CloudFront supports Anycast Static IPs from all CloudFront edge locations. This excludes Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) region, operated by NWCD. Standard CloudFront pricing applies, with additional charges for Anycast Static IP addresses.
