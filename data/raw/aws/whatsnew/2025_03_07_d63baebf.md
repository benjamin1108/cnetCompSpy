# Application Load Balancer announces integration with Amazon VPC IPAM

Posted on: Mar 7, 2025 

AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) now allows customers to provide a pool of public IPv4 addresses for IP address assignment to load balancer nodes. Customers can configure a public IP Address Manager (IPAM) pool that can consist of either Bring Your Own IP addresses (BYOIPs) that is customer owned or a contiguous IPv4 address block provided by Amazon.  
  
With this feature, customers can optimize public IPv4 cost by using BYOIP in public IPAM pools. Customers can also simplify their enterprise allowlisting and operations, by using Amazon-provided contiguous IPv4 blocks in public IPAM pools. The ALB's IP addresses are sourced from the IPAM pool and automatically switch to AWS managed IP addresses when the public IPAM pool is depleted. This intelligent switching maximizes service availability during scaling events.  
  
The feature is available in [all commercial AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) and [AWS GovCloud (US) ](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/)Regions where Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is available. To learn more, please refer to the [ALB Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html#ip-pools).
