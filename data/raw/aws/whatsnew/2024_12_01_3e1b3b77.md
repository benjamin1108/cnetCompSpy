# AWS announces AWS Data Transfer Terminal for high-speed data uploads

Posted on: Dec 1, 2024 

Today, AWS announces the launch of AWS Data Transfer Terminal, a secure, physical location where you can bring your storage devices, connect directly to the AWS network, and upload data to AWS including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), and others using a high throughput connection. Currently, Data Transfer Terminals are located in Los Angeles, and New York. You can reserve a time slot to visit your nearest Data Transfer Terminal facility to upload data.  
  
AWS Data Transfer Terminals are ideal for customer scenarios that create or collect large amounts of data that need to be transferred to the AWS cloud quickly and securely on an as-needed basis. These use cases span various industries and applications, including video production data for processing in the media and entertainment industry, training data for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in the automotive industry, migrating legacy data in the financial services industry, and uploading equipment sensor data in the industrial and agricultural . By using Data Transfer Terminal, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to upload large amounts of data, enabling you to process ingested data within minutes, as opposed to days or weeks. Once data is uploaded to AWS, you can efficiently analyze large datasets with Amazon Athena, train and run machine learning models with ingested data using Amazon SageMaker, or build scalable applications using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
