# VPC Lattice now includes TCP support with VPC Resources

Posted on: Dec 2, 2024 

With the launch of VPC Resources for Amazon VPC Lattice, you can now access all of your application dependencies through a VPC Lattice service network. You're able to connect to your application dependencies hosted in different VPCs, accounts, and on-premises using additional protocols, including TLS, HTTP, HTTPS, and now TCP. This new feature expands upon the existing HTTP-based services support, enabling you to share a wider range of resources across your organization.  
  
With VPC Resource support, you can add your TCP resources, such as Amazon RDS databases, custom DNS, or IP endpoints, to a VPC Lattice service network. Now, you can share and connect to all your application dependencies, such as HTTP APIs and TCP databases, across thousands of VPCs, simplifying network management and providing centralized visibility with built-in access controls.  
  
VPC Resources are generally available with VPC Lattice in Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Middle East (Bahrain), South America (Sao Paulo), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon).
