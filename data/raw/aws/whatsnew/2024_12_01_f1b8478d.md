# AWS Verified Access now supports secure access to resources over non-HTTP(S) protocols (Preview) 

Posted on: Dec 1, 2024 

Today, AWS announces the preview of AWS Verified Access’ new feature that supports secure access to resources that connect over protocols such as TCP, SSH, and, RDP. With this launch, Verified Access enables you to provide secure, VPN-less access to your corporate applications and resources using [AWS zero trust principles](https://aws.amazon.com/security/zero-trust/). This feature eliminates the need to manage separate access and connectivity solutions for your non-HTTP(S) resources on AWS and simplifies security operations.  
  
Verified Access evaluates each access request in real time based on the user’s identity and device posture, using fine-grained policies. With this feature, you can extend your existing Verified Access policies to enable secure access to non-HTTP(S) resources such as git-repositories, databases, and a group of EC2 instances. For example, you can create centrally managed policies that grant SSH access across your EC2 fleet to only authenticated members of the system administration team, while ensuring that connections are permitted only from compliant devices. This simplifies your security operations by allowing you to create, group, and manage access policies for applications and resources with similar security requirements from a single interface.  
  
This feature of AWS Verified Access is available in preview in 18 AWS regions: US East (Ohio), US East (Northern Virginia), US West (N California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Milan), Europe (Stockholm), South America (São Paulo), and, Israel (Tel Aviv).
