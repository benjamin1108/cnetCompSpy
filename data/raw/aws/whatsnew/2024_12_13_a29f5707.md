# AWS announces new AWS Direct Connect location in Osaka, Japan

Posted on: Dec 13, 2024 

Today, AWS announced the opening of a new [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect) location within the Telehouse OS2 data center in Osaka, Japan. By connecting your network to AWS at the new Osaka location, you gain private, direct access to all public AWS Regions (except those in China), AWS GovCloud Regions, and [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/). This is the second AWS Direct Connect site within the Osaka Metropolitan area and the fifth site in Japan.  
  
The Direct Connect service enables you to establish a private, physical network connection between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. These private connections can provide a more consistent network experience than those made over the public internet. The new Direct Connect location at Telehouse OS2 offers dedicated 1G, 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps connections with MACsec encryption available.  
  
For more information on the over 145 Direct Connect locations worldwide, visit the [locations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/locations/) section of the Direct Connect [product detail pages](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect). Or, visit our [getting started](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/getting-started/) page to learn more about how to purchase and deploy Direct Connect.
