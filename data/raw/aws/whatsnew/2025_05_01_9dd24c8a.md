# Amazon VPC IPAM now allows cost distribution to AWS Organization member-accounts

Posted on: May 1, 2025 

Today, AWS announced the ability for Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) to distribute IPAM costs to AWS Organizations member accounts. This allows you to easily allocate costs to your internal teams for their IPAM usage.  
  
VPC IPAM makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads. When you enable IPAM for your AWS Organization, IPAM aggregates the organization-wide IP address usage, and charges the AWS account in which IPAM is created. With this launch, you can allocate the charges directly to AWS Organizations member accounts, for their individual usage. For example, you may have IPAM enabled in a central AWS account that runs multiple networking services, and want to allocate the IPAM charges across your internal teams, which you can do easily using this feature.  
  
This feature is now available in all [*AWS Regions*](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) where Amazon VPC IPAM is supported, including AWS China Regions, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.  
  
To learn more about IPAM, view the [IPAM documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html). For details on pricing, refer to the IPAM tab on the [Amazon VPC Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/).
