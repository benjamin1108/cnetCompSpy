# Amazon Location Service now supports AWS PrivateLink

Posted on: Feb 25, 2025 

We are excited to announce that Amazon Location Service now supports [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html) integration, enabling customers to establish private connectivity between their VPCs and Amazon Location Service without data ever traversing the public internet.  
  
With this new capability, customers can now access Amazon Location Service APIs through private IP addresses within their VPC, significantly enhancing their security posture. This integration simplifies network architecture by eliminating the need for internet gateways, NAT devices, or public IP addresses, while helping customers meet strict regulatory and compliance requirements by keeping all traffic within the AWS network.  
  
Setting up AWS PrivateLink for Amazon Location Service is straightforward. Customers can create interface VPC endpoints through the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands. Once configured, applications can immediately begin accessing Amazon Location Service APIs using private IP addresses, with all traffic remaining secure within the AWS network.  
  
To learn more about using AWS PrivateLink with Amazon Location, see the [Amazon Location Service developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html).
