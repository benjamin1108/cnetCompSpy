# Amazon Lightsail API endpoints now support connectivity over Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)

Posted on: Dec 23, 2024 

Amazon Lightsail API endpoints now support the IPv6 protocol, allowing you to connect over IPv6. To use this new capability, point your applications to use Amazon Lightsail’s new dual-stack endpoints. When you make a request to a dual-stack endpoint, the endpoint URL resolves to an IPv6 or an IPv4 address, depending on the protocol used by your network and client.  
  
Public IPv4 addresses are being exhausted with the growth of the Internet. Earlier this year, Lightsail [launched](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/01/ipv6-instance-bundles-amazon-lightsail/) IPv6-only instance plans to support IPv6 adoption. With the introduction of dual-stack Lightsail API endpoints, you can now make requests to the Lightsail API from your Lightsail IPv6-only instances, or any IPv6 client.  
  
You can use this capability with the [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) in all AWS Regions supporting Lightsail. To learn more, please see [AWS Service Endpoints documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#dual-stack-endpoints) and [Lightsail Service Endpoints documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html).
