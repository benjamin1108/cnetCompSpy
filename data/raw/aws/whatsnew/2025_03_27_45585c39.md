# Amazon VPC IP Address Manager is now available in two additional AWS Regions

Posted on: Mar 27, 2025 

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud [IP Address Manager (Amazon VPC IPAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html) that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads, is now available in Asia Pacific (Thailand) and Mexico (Central) Regions.  
  
Amazon VPC IPAM allows you to easily organize your IP addresses based on your routing and security needs, and set simple business rules to govern IP address assignments. Using VPC IPAM, you can automate IP address assignment to Amazon VPCs and VPC Subnets, eliminating the need to use spreadsheet-based or homegrown IP address planning applications, which can be hard to maintain and time-consuming.  
  
With this expansion, Amazon VPC IPAM is available in all [AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/), including China (Beijing, operated by Sinnet), and China (Ningxia, operated by NWCD), and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.  
  
To learn more about IPAM, view the [IPAM documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html). For details on pricing, refer to the IPAM tab on the [Amazon VPC Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/).
