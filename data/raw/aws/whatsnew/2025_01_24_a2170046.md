# AWS announces new edge location in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

Posted on: Jan 24, 2025 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) announces expansion in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by launching a new Amazon CloudFront edge location in Jeddah. The new AWS edge location brings the full suite of benefits provided by [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), a secure, highly distributed, and scalable content delivery network (CDN) that delivers static and dynamic content, APIs, and live and on-demand video with low latency and high performance.  
  
All Amazon CloudFront edge locations are protected against infrastructure-level DDoS threats with [AWS Shield Standard](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/) that uses always-on network flow monitoring and in-line mitigation to minimize application latency and downtime. You also have the ability to add additional layers of security for applications to protect them against common web exploits and bot attacks by enabling [AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/).  
  
Traffic delivered from this edge location is included within the Middle East [region pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/). To learn more about AWS edge locations, see [CloudFront edge locations](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/).
