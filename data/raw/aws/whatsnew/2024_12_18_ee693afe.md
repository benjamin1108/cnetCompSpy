# AWS Backup now supports dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environments

Posted on: Dec 18, 2024 

AWS Backup introduces dual stack support for the AWS Backup API endpoint in IPv6, enabling you to connect using Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), or dual stack clients. Dual stack support is also available when the AWS Backup API endpoint is privately accessed from your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/). Dual stack endpoints are made available on a new AWS DNS domain name. The existing AWS Backup API endpoints are maintained for backwards compatibility reasons.  
  
With simultaneous support for both IPv4 and IPv6 clients on AWS Backup endpoints, you are able to gradually transition from IPv4 to IPv6 based systems and applications, without needing to switch all over at once. This enables you to meet IPv6 compliance requirements and removes the need for expensive networking equipment to handle the address translation between IPv4 and IPv6.  
  
AWS Backup support for dual-stack environments is available in all regions where [AWS Backup support for VPC endpoints is available](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-privatelink.html#availability-for-vpc-endpoints). There is no additional charge when you connect to AWS Backup endpoints using Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) clients. To learn more, see AWS Backup [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-privatelink.html).
