# Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall is now available in additional regions

Posted on: May 1, 2025 

Starting today, you can use Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall and DNS Firewall Advanced in the Asia Pacific (Thailand) and Mexico (Central) Regions, to govern and filter outbound DNS traffic for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).  
  
Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall is a managed service that enables you to block DNS queries made for domains identified as low-reputation or suspected to be malicious, and to allow queries for trusted domains. In addition, Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall Advanced is a capability of DNS Firewall that allows you to detect and block DNS traffic associated with Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) and DNS Tunneling threats. DNS Firewall can be enabled only for Route 53 Resolver, which is a recursive DNS server that is available by default in all Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The Route 53 Resolver responds to DNS queries from AWS resources within a VPC for public DNS records, VPC-specific domain names, and Route 53 private hosted zones.
