# Amazon VPC Reachability Analyzer and Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer are now available in Europe (Spain) Region

Posted on: Apr 24, 2025 

With this launch, VPC Reachability Analyzer and VPC Network Access Analyzer are now available in Europe (Spain) Region.  
  
VPC Reachability Analyzer allows you to diagnose network reachability between a source resource and a destination resource in your virtual private clouds (VPCs) by analyzing your network configurations.For example, Reachability Analyzer can help you identify a missing route table entry in your VPC route table that could be blocking network reachability between an EC2 instance in Account A that is not able to connect to another EC2 instance in Account B in your AWS Organization.  
  
VPC Network Access Analyzer allows you to identify unintended network access to your resources on AWS. Using Network Access Analyzer, you can verify whether network access for your VPC resources meets your security and compliance guidelines. For example, you can create a scope to verify that the VPCs used by your Finance team are separate, distinct, and unreachable from the VPCs used by your Development team.
