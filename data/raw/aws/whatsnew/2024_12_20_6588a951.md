# AWS Network Firewall now supports IPv6 Service Endpoints

Posted on: Dec 20, 2024 

AWS Network Firewall introduces dual stack support for Network Firewall management API, enabling you to connect using Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), or dual stack clients. Dual stack support is also available when the AWS Network Firewall management API endpoint is privately accessed from your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using AWS [PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/amazon-eks-supports-aws-privatelink/). Dual stack endpoints are made available on a new AWS DNS domain name. The existing AWS Network Firewall management API endpoints are maintained for backwards compatibility reasons.  
  
AWS Network Firewall is a managed firewall service that is easy to deploy. The service automatically scales with network traffic volume to provide high-availability protections without the need to set up and maintain the underlying infrastructure. With simultaneous support for both IPv4 and IPv6 clients on AWS Network Firewall endpoints, you are able to gradually transition from IPv4 to IPv6 based systems and applications, without needing to switch all over at once. There is no additional charge when you connect to AWS Network Firewall endpoints using Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) clients.
