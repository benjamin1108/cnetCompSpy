# AWS Network Firewall introduces automated domain lists and insights

Posted on: Feb 19, 2025 

[AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/) now offers automated domain lists and insights, a feature that enhances visibility into network traffic and simplifies firewall rule configuration. This new capability analyzes HTTP and HTTPS traffic logs from the last 30 days and provides insights into frequently accessed domains, enabling quick rule creation based on observed network traffic patterns.  
  
Many organizations now use allow-list policies to limit access to approved destinations only. Automated domain lists reduce the time and effort required to identify necessary domains, configure initial rules, and update allow lists as business needs change. This feature helps quickly identify legitimate traffic while maintaining a restrictive default stance, balancing security with operational efficiency.  
  
This feature is supported in all [AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) where AWS Network Firewall is available today. There is no additional cost to generate automated domain lists and insights on AWS Network Firewall.  
  
To get started, visit the AWS Network Firewall console and enable analysis mode for your firewall. For more information, please refer to the AWS Network Firewall service [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-creating.html).
