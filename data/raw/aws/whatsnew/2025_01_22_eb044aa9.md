# AWS Client VPN announces support for concurrent VPN connections

Posted on: Jan 22, 2025 

Today, AWS announces the general availability of concurrent VPN connections for AWS Client VPN. This feature allows you to securely connect to multiple Client VPN connections simultaneously, enabling access to your resources across different work environments.  
  
AWS Client VPN allows your users to securely connect to your network remotely from any location. Previously, you could only connect to one VPN profile at a time. This limited your access to only one network. To access another network, you were required to disconnect and reconnect to a different VPN profile. With this launch, you can connect to multiple VPN profiles simultaneously without switching. For example, software developers using AWS client for VPN can now connect to development, test, and production environment concurrently. This feature allows seamless parallel connections to all required environments, significantly improving productivity for end users.  
  
This feature is available only with AWS-supplied Client VPN client version 5.0+. You can download this version following the steps [here](https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/). This feature and the required client version are available at no additional cost in all AWS regions where AWS Client VPN is generally available.
