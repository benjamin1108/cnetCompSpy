# Amazon Connect Contact Lens real-time dashboards are now available in AWS GovCloud (US-West)

Posted on: May 5, 2025 

Amazon Connect Contact Lens real-time queue and agent performance dashboards, and flows performance dashboards are now available in AWS GovCloud (US-West), a secure cloud environment designed for government and public sector customers. The new dashboard lets you monitor real-time agent activity and take immediate actions such as listen-in to a contact, barge (take over) a contact, or change an agent state in a few clicks from a single interface. The dashboards now allow you to define widget level filters and groupings, re-order and re-size columns, and delete or add new metrics. With these dashboards, you can view and compare real-time and historical aggregated performance, trends, and insights using custom-defined time periods (e.g., week over week), summary charts, time-series chart, etc. For example, you can automatically highlight in red if an agent is an error state to give a quick visual indicator of where agents might need additional help to change their status back to available.  
  
Amazon Connect Contact Len’s dashboards are available in all AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) where Amazon Connect is offered.
