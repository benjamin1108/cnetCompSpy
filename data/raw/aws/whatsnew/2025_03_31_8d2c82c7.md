# AWS announces new AWS Direct Connect location in Athens, Greece

Posted on: Mar 31, 2025 

Today, AWS announced the opening of a new AWS Direct Connect location within the Digital Realty ATH3 data center near Athens, Greece. By connecting your network to AWS at the new location, you gain private, direct access to all public AWS Regions (except those in China), AWS GovCloud Regions, and [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/). This site is the first AWS Direct Connect location within Greece. This Direct Connect location offers dedicated 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps connections with MACsec encryption available.  
  
The Direct Connect service enables you to establish a private, physical network connection between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. These private connections can provide a more consistent network experience than those made over the public internet.  
  
For more information on the over 147 Direct Connect locations worldwide, visit the [locations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/locations/) section of the Direct Connect [product detail pages](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect). Or, visit our [getting started](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/getting-started/) page to learn more about how to purchase and deploy Direct Connect.
