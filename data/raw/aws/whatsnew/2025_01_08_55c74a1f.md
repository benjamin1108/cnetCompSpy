# Amazon MSK Connect APIs now support AWS PrivateLink

Posted on: Jan 8, 2025 

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Connect (Amazon MSK Connect) APIs now come with [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) support, allowing you to invoke Amazon MSK Connect APIs from within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without traversing the public internet.  
  
By default, all communication between your MSK Clusters and your Amazon MSK Connect connectors is private, and your data never traverses the internet. Similar to AWS PrivateLink support for Amazon MSK APIs, this launch enables clients to invoke MSK Connect APIs via a private endpoint. This allows client applications with strict security requirements to perform MSK Connect specific actions such as creating connectors from new or existing custom plugins, listing and describing connector details, or updating connectors, without the need to communicate over a public connection.  
  
AWS PrivateLink support for Amazon MSK Connect is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon MSK Connect is available. To get started, follow the directions provided in the [AWS PrivateLink documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.html). To learn more about Amazon MSK Connect, visit the Amazon MSK Connect [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-connect.html).
