# AWS PrivateLink now supports cross-region connectivity

Posted on: Nov 26, 2024 

AWS PrivateLink now supports native cross-region connectivity. Until now, Interface VPC endpoints only supported connectivity to VPC endpoint services in the same region. This launch enables customers to connect to VPC endpoint services hosted in other AWS Regions in the same AWS [pa](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/partitions.html#:~:text=AWS%20groups%20Regions%20into%20partitions,resources%20in%20a%20different%20partition.)[rtition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/partitions.html#:~:text=AWS%20groups%20Regions%20into%20partitions,resources%20in%20a%20different%20partition.) over Interface endpoints.  
  
As a service provider, you can enable access to your VPCE service for customers in all existing and upcoming AWS Regions without the need to setup additional infrastructure in each region. As a service consumer, you can privately connect to VPCE services in other AWS Regions without the need to setup cross-region peering or exposing your data over the public internet. Cross-region enabled VPCE services can be accessed through Interface endpoints at a private IP address in your VPC, enabling simpler and more secure inter-region connectivity.
