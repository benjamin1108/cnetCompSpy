# AWS announces new AWS Direct Connect location in Brisbane, Australia

Posted on: May 8, 2025 

Today, AWS announced the opening of a new [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect) location within the NEXTDC B2 data center near Brisbane, Australia. By connecting your network to AWS at the new location, you gain private, direct access to all public AWS Regions (except those in China), AWS GovCloud Regions, and [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/). This site is the first AWS Direct Connect location in Brisbane and the eight AWS Direct connect location within Australia. This Direct Connect location offers dedicated 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps connections with MACsec encryption available.  
  
The Direct Connect service enables you to establish a private, physical network connection between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. These private connections can provide a more consistent network experience than those made over the public internet.  
  
For more information on the over 148 Direct Connect locations worldwide, visit the [locations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/locations/) section of the Direct Connect [product detail pages](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect). Or, visit our [getting started](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/getting-started/) page to learn more about how to purchase and deploy Direct Connect.
