# AWS simplifies Amazon VPC Peering billing

Posted on: Apr 11, 2025 

Starting today, we are making it easier for customers to understand their inter-availability zone (AZ) VPC Peering usage within the same AWS Region by introducing a new usage type in their bill. These changes won’t affect customers’ charges and will help them easily understand their VPC Peering costs, enabling them to choose the right architecture based on cost, performance, and ease of management.  
  
VPC Peering is an Amazon VPC feature that allows customers to establish networking connection between two VPCs, helping them route traffic between two VPCs using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Previously, VPC Peering usage was reported under the intra-regional Data Transfer usage, making it difficult for customers to understand their VPC Peering usage and charges. With this launch, customers can now view their VPC Peering usage using the new usage type “Region_Name-VpcPeering-In/Out-Bytes” in [Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) or [Cost and Usage Report](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-and-usage-reporting/). Customers do not need to make any changes to their existing VPC Peering connections to benefit from this change, as these changes will be automatically applied.  
  
There are no changes to the pricing for data transferred over VPC Peering connections. These changes will apply to all AWS commercial and the AWS Gov Cloud (US) Regions.
