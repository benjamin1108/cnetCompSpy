# Amazon Route 53 Profiles now supports VPC endpoints

Posted on: Apr 28, 2025 

Today, AWS announced support for VPC endpoints in Amazon Route 53 Profiles, allowing you to create, manage, and share private hosted zones (PHZs) for interface VPC endpoints across multiple VPCs and AWS accounts within your organization. With this enhancement, Amazon Route 53 Profiles simplifies the management of VPC endpoints by streamlining the process of creating and associating interface VPC endpoint managed PHZs with VPCs and AWS accounts, and without requiring you to manually associate them.  
  
Route 53 Profiles makes it easy for you to create one or more configurations for VPC-related DNS settings, such as private hosted zones and Route 53 Resolver rules, and share them across VPCs and AWS accounts. The new capability helps you centralize the management of PHZs associated with interface VPC endpoints, reducing administrative overhead and minimizing the risk of configuration errors. This feature eliminates the need for creation and manual association of PHZs for VPC endpoints with individual VPCs and accounts, saving time and effort for network administrators. Additionally, it improves security and consistency by providing a centralized approach to managing DNS resolution for VPC endpoints across an organization's AWS infrastructure.  
  
Route 53 Profiles support for VPC endpoints is now available in the AWS Regions mentioned [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/r53.html). To learn more about the capability and how it can benefit your organization, visit the Amazon Route 53 [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/profiles.html). You can get started by accessing the Amazon Route 53 console in your AWS Management Console or through AWS CLI.
