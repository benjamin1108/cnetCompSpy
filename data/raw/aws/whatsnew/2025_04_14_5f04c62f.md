# AWS Lambda@Edge announces advanced logging controls

Posted on: Apr 14, 2025 

AWS Lambda@Edge now supports [AWS Lambda’s advanced logging controls](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/) to improve how function logs are captured, processed, and consumed at the edge. This enhancement provides you with more control over your logging data, making it easier to monitor application behavior and quickly resolve issues.  
  
The new advanced logging controls for Lambda@Edge give you three flexible ways to manage and analyze your logs. New JSON structured logs make it easier to search, filter, and analyze large volumes of log entries without using custom logging libraries. Log level granularity controls can switch log levels instantly, allowing you to filter for specific types of logs like errors or debug information when investigating issues. Custom CloudWatch log group selection lets you choose which Amazon CloudWatch log group Lambda@Edge sends logs to, making it easier to aggregate and manage logs at scale.  
  
To get started, you can specify advanced logging controls for your Lambda functions using Lambda APIs, Lambda console, AWS CLI, AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), and AWS CloudFormation. To learn more, visit the [Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html#monitoring-cloudwatchlogs-advanced), and the [CloudFront Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/edge-functions-logs.html#lambda-at-edge-logs).
