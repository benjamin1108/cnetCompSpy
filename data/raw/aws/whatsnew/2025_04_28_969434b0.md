# Announcing SaaS Manager for Amazon CloudFront

Posted on: Apr 28, 2025 

Today, AWS announces CloudFront SaaS Manager, a new Amazon CloudFront feature designed to efficiently manage content delivery across multiple websites for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers, web development platforms, and companies with multiple brands/websites. CloudFront SaaS Manager provides a unified experience, alleviating the operational burden of managing multiple websites at scale, including TLS certificate management, DDoS protection, and observability.  
  
CloudFront SaaS Manager introduces reusable configuration settings, eliminating redundant configurations and allowing customers to maintain consistent settings across their websites. This not only saves time but also reduces the potential for errors in configuration. With CloudFront SaaS Manager, customers benefit from optimal CDN and security defaults, ensuring high performance and secure protections following AWS best practices. Additionally, CloudFront SaaS Manager can automate requesting, issuing, and associating TLS certificates with CloudFront through a simplified AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) integration. This addresses the growing complexity in certificate management, security policy enforcement, and cross-account synchronization that companies face as their customer base expands.
