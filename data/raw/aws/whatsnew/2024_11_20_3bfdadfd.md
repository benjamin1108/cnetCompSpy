# Amazon CloudFront now supports Anycast Static IPs

Posted on: Nov 20, 2024 

Amazon CloudFront introduces Anycast Static IPs, providing customers with a dedicated list of IP addresses for connecting to all CloudFront edge locations worldwide.  
  
Typically, CloudFront uses rotating IP addresses to serve traffic. Customers implementing Anycast Static IPs will receive a dedicated list of static IP addresses for their workloads. CloudFront Anycast Static IPs enables customers to provide a dedicated list of IP addresses to partners and their customers for enhancing security and simplifying network management across various use cases. For example, a common use case is allow-listing the static IP addresses in network firewalls.  
  
CloudFront supports Anycast Static IPs from all edge locations. This excludes Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) region, operated by NWCD. CloudFormation support will be coming soon.
