# Fortifying network security

In an era where cyber threats are more sophisticated and pervasive than ever, traditional security practices are no longer sufficient to protect critical assets and data. Zero Trust Network Security is not just a concept—it’s an imperative, built around the principle that systems should be “Secure by Default”.

[Protect your network and apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/network-security/)

### Network Security Perimeter

In today’s digital landscape, businesses need an unwavering commitment to security, especially when utilizing Azure’s Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings for critical functions. Ensuring data confidentiality and integrity remains a priority, especially as applications interact across diverse PaaS resources. However, traditional methods of securing these interactions have limits, often relying on broad access allowances to Azure services—beyond what businesses would ideally permit. 

![diagram](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Picture1-2-1024x725.webp)

Network Security Perimeter precisely addresses this need by establishing a trusted perimeter that governs interactions between designated PaaS instances. Network Security Perimeter’s controls—such as Access Control List (ACL) rules and centralized logging—enable businesses to confine communication to authorized resources, enhancing security across the PaaS environment. Network Security Perimeter is a foundational step toward Zero Trust security principles, ensuring comprehensive ingress and egress control over business-critical interactions. 

### Bastion by default

As part of our mission to provide a “secure by default” platform for our customers, I am excited to highlight a recent announcement of ours, the **general availability of the Bastion Developer SKU**. The Bastion service is used by a multitude of customers in Azure to enable remote desktop (RDP) and secure shell (SSH) access for their virtual machines (VMs) without exposing them publicly to the Internet. This was made possible by a fully managed and dedicated Bastion server running inside the virtual network. Now, with Bastion Developer SKU, we are offering a “no cost” solution that allows users to establish a secure one-click connection to a single VM at a time without exposing public IPs on the VMs. Bastion Developer SKU utilizes a shared pool of resources managed internally by Microsoft for secure VM connectivity. Users can directly access their VMs through the connect experience on the VM blade in Azure portal, with support for RDP/SSH and SSH-only for CLI sessions. Bastion Developer is perfect for users seeking secure VM connections without the need for additional features, configuration, or scaling at no additional cost.

### Virtual network encryption

With the rapid growth of data-sensitive industries like finance, healthcare, and government, there is a critical need for uncompromising network security to protect sensitive information and ensure regulatory compliance. Azure’s **virtual network encryption** addresses this need by providing an efficient solution for encrypting communications between VMs within a virtual network. Now generally available across all public Azure regions, this feature represents a significant advancement in secure network design, enabling organizations to safeguard data in transit between VMs without sacrificing performance or agility.

Virtual network encryption leverages the f**ield programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)** , in the host for encrypting the data which allows for the process to be handled with high efficiency. By offloading encryption to FPGAs, Azure combines top-notch security with high-speed processing, ensuring that encrypted data flows smoothly across the network while minimizing the impact on overall system performance.

### DNSSEC

Along similar lines, today we are happy to announce the **public preview of**[DNSSEC support in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dns/dnssec). With this, customers can turn on DNSSEC on their Domain Name System (DNS) configuration with a simple opt-in from portal and API. DNSSEC is a critical security feature that helps mitigate issues such as cache poisoning and man in the middle attacks, thereby significantly enhancing security for our customers. DNSSEC ensures the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses, providing an additional layer of protection against cyber threats. Moreover, several countries now require the use of DNSSEC making it an essential update for compliance. With DNSSEC, Azure DNS continues to deliver robust and secure DNS solutions, empowering businesses to operate with confidence in a safer digital environment. 

# Pushing the boundaries on resiliency and reliability

We are equally committed to providing a world-class resilient and reliable network infrastructure to support customers’ mission critical workloads. In this regard, I want to highlight several recent enhancements in the platform that bolster this commitment.

### ExpressRoute: Enhancing resiliency and high availability

In today’s cloud-centric world, ensuring resilient and reliable connectivity is essential, particularly for organizations with mission-critical applications. Azure ExpressRoute offers private, high-throughput connections between on-premises environments and Azure, bypassing public internet traffic to deliver lower latency and consistent performance.

To further strengthen reliability, we’re excited to announce **ExpressRoute Metro SKU** , now generally available. The Metro SKU offers redundancy across multiple edge sites within the same city, guarding against disruptions at any single location. This multi-site design allows organizations to build highly available network architectures that remain operational even during unexpected outages at one edge site.

For those needing additional failover protection, **maximum resiliency** with ExpressRoute provides dual redundant paths to each edge site, effectively establishing four independent paths to Azure. This feature is invaluable for sectors like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, where consistent connectivity is critical for compliance and business continuity.

Additionally, to simplify implementation, Azure now offers a **guided configuration experience** for multi-site ExpressRoute. This new feature in the Azure portal provides users with a dynamic topology map and recommendations for optimal site configuration, empowering teams to make informed decisions for resilient network deployments.

### Azure Load Balancer: Improved manageability

[Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/load-balancer/), one of the foundational services in the networking portfolio, is a cloud-native high performance network load balancer that is commonly used in customer deployments. While we continue to improve the usability, applicability, and scale to meet evolving customer requirements, a few new announcements in this space will improve the manageability of load balancer significantly.

**Admin state**

The new “Admin State” functionality of Load Balancer will allow customers to mark a backend instance healthy or unhealthy to influence traffic being directed to the instance. Controlling the status of the load balancer backend is typically done through health probes. However, customers do have a need to explicitly override the health status to take a VM instance out of rotation for maintenance, upgrades or security patching or simply for other customer needs. Instead of implementing response logic and Network Security Group (NSG) rules blocks, customers can simply mark the instance as unhealthy through an API call or a single click in portal and bring it back the same way. We are also enhancing the observability of backend health through our new and improved “Load Balancer Health Status” that provides deep insights into backend instance health covering both user and platform triggered reason codes.

![Diagram showing how Azure Load Balancer's Admin State flows.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Picture4.webp)

Admin state and load balancer health status are both now generally available in all public cloud regions, Azure China cloud regions and Azure Government cloud regions.

**Cross-subscription support**

Customers’ estate in Azure is usually spread across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks in Azure and even managed by different personnel and departments. Customers find it restrictive to build an application topology just using resources in a single subscription, especially when using basic primitives like load balancers. To address this, Azure load balancers is announcing general availability of cross-subscription usage between front end public IP address, load balancer resource and the backend instances. Such cross-subscription usage allows for better use of resources and avoids duplication.

# Managing operations at scale

As organizations scale their cloud environments to accommodate growth, they require network solutions that not only expand capacity but also ensure efficient, reliable, and secure connectivity. Azure’s recent advancements in Virtual Network management respond to this need by providing robust tools for IP scalability, efficient address management, and advanced network verification.

### Virtual Network Ip Address

A virtual network today supports 65,000 routable IP addresses that could be assigned to virtual machines, virtual machine scale set instances, and pods in an AKS cluster. While this limit is more than sufficient for most customers in Azure, some of our cloud-native customers do require higher scale to keep up with instant demands and frequent scale-out and scale-in operations. To address this, Azure is excited to announce the support of “**1 million routable IP Addresses** ” in a virtual network in preview via the “Ip Prefix on the Network Interface Card” (NIC) feature. This ability allows an additional /28 prefix to be added to the NIC along with a primary /32 Ip address. This increases the usable IP space in a NIC by 16 times.

### Virtual Network IP address manager

With more IP addresses to use and manage in Azure, the greater the need for an IP address management system becomes. We are happy to **announce the public preview (and soon general availability) of the IP Address Management (IPAM) solution in Azure Virtual Network manager** in all public cloud regions. IPAM allows organizations to centrally manage their IP address pool making it easier to plan, allocate, avoid overlaps, and monitor usage of IP address blocks. Customers can also leverage automatic IP address allocation when new virtual networks are created to ensure uniqueness and reduce wastage. IPAM also helps with tracking IP allocations outside Azure making it an all-encompassing solution. IPAM supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address prefixes.

### Virtual network verifier

As customers scale their environments in Aure, the tougher it becomes to debug and troubleshoot network connectivity issues. Azure Network Monitoring and Network Watcher helps with real time diagnostics and troubleshooting tools. Azure Virtual Network Manager’s virtual network verifier system which is available in preview in all public cloud regions today adds another layer of functionality by providing a static analysis of packer flow based on configuration and control plane changes. Customers can validate their packet flows even before they deploy the configuration changes to reduce the possibility of connection interruptions and packet loss.
