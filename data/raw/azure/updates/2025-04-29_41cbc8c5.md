router, also called virtual hub router, acts as a route manager and provides
simplification in routing operation within and across virtual hubs. The virtual
hub router exposes the ability to peer with it, thereby exchanging routing information
directly through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol. With the
added support for Next hop IP in Virtual WAN, you can peer the hub with NVAs or
BGP endpoints and advertise routes for VMs that are deployed behind a load balancer.</span></div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><a href="https://aka.ms/nexthopip">Learn more</a>.</div>
